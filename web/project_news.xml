			<title>Welcome CSE undergrads!</title>
			<description>I'd like to welcome the following four undergrads here in Seattle from the UW Computer Science &#38;amp; Engineering department. They will be working with me this quarter to build a new yellow box from scratch, and next quarter, we will use it to terrorize a 1/6th-scale cardboard replica of Tokyo.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;The students are!&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Jeffrey Booth&#60;br /&#62;Rob McClure&#60;br /&#62;David Nufer&#60;br /&#62;John Williams&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;They might be giants. It's hard to tell if we are living in a diorama or not. (&#60;a href=&#34;http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=1049346&#34;&#62;0 comments&#60;/a&#62;)</description>

			<title>New pulse programming blog</title>
			<description>Originally I've sent weekly e-mail updates to the dev mailing list, but I thought these might be fun and informative for public consumption as well. So now I will just updates via blog posts here:&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://pulsing.wordpress.com/&#34;&#62;http://pulsing.wordpress.com/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;I know that SourceForge has a Hosted App feature for Wordpress, but it is lame and doesn't support switching themes. The blog will just contain progress updates for now and will be kept separate from project news, although it's possible I will use it for all news in the future.

			<title>Presentation to CSE undergrads</title>
			<description>Here are the graphics / slides for the brief, 10-minute talk Aaron and I gave to undergrads in the CSE 467 (Advanced Digital Design) class this morning. Our goal is to encourage more engineering students to participate in the pulse programmer and to connect them with physicists who need engineering collaborators.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Title slide: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulpham/4048493405/&#34;&#62;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulpham/4048493405/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Programmed pulse waveforms: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulpham/4049240762/&#34;&#62;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulpham/4049240762/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Ion trap photos from Boris's lab: &#60;a href=&#34;http://depts.washington.edu/qcomp/pictures.html&#34;&#62;http://depts.washington.edu/qcomp/pictures.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Map of current pulse programmer users: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulpham/4049241794/&#34;&#62;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulpham/4049241794/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Map of groups evaluating the pulse programmer: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulpham/4048494665/&#34;&#62;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulpham/4048494665/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Map of all known ion trap groups around the world and potential users of the pulse programmer: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulpham/4048494281/&#34;&#62;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulpham/4048494281/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Thanks to Carl Ebeling for giving us this opportunity and agreeing to collaborate on this project. The course syllabus is eerily relevant to the pulse programmer project, as you can see for yourself:&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/467/09au/html/syllabus.html&#34;&#62;http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/467/09au/html/syllabus.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;I will write up my commentary to go with the above slides soon, as a blog post.

			<title>Welcome back, Aaron!</title>
			<description>Aaron has returned from California and southeast Asia to work on the yellow box in Boris's lab this quarter, as part of his secret bonus year at UW. I am sure you are all relieved that I am not wandering around without undergraduate supervision.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Also, I've updated the People page with the right names and affiliations, at least in Seattle. Please feel free to add to this page to describe your specific contributions to the project. I would also like to add photos soon, links to theses, and &#38;quot;where are they now&#38;quot; news.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/pulse-sequencer/wiki/People&#34;&#62;https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/pulse-sequencer/wiki/People&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;If you want to join the project and get wiki edit permissions, please create a SourceForge account and submit a request for the pulse-sequencer group.

			<title>Belated farewell to Frank</title>
			<description>I had a good-bye lunch with Frank two weeks ago. He is probably well on his way to New Mexico now on a family roadtrip, where I hope he gets to see White Sands National Monument, the Earthship village in Taos, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. Good luck in your future plans, Frank!&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;In related news, the fall quarter just started here at UW yesterday. This means new students have arrived who might be recruited into the Clandestine Order of Pulse Programmers and Electronics Researchers (COPPER).
